This Python script processes PDB files containing protein structures. It extracts information regarding amino acid sequences and structural patterns such as helices and sheets from PDB files, generating a FASTA file and a text file containing this data. Additionally, it creates a summary detailing the count and names of the examined PDB files. The code also calculates and appends the mean and standard deviation of protein lengths to the FASTA file, offering insights into the protein structure variability within the PDB files.
